## Overview and Goals
### Project Goals

This is a Code Institute Milestone 1 Project on the Full Stack Course. The project focuses on Front End Development Skills using HTML5 and CSS3.

The project is to build a website for Music Producer Chris Fielding.  Chris is in need of a website which will be the main port and call for new clients. Whilst existing clients are likely to send him an email, new clients should have the opportunity to find out information on Chris and be able to send him an email from the site. Most users visiting the site will be looking to hire Chris for Producing, Mixing or Mastering. Every project has to be priced individually dependent on client specifications, and this is done via email or phone.
The site should have intuitive navigation, so that enquiries are able to be submitted to Chris efficiently.  It should also be responsive across multiple well known devices including phone, tablet and desktop.

### Business Goals

The main goal for this website is to increase traffic and enquiries for Chris, which will increase bookings and therefore revenue. 
The website will look professional and this will also contribute to increased bookings and revenue.

## Design and UX

### User Stories
 -  I am in a heavy metal band, and I want to to be able to see what projects Chris has worked on to see if his sound would suit our music. It would be good to be able to see the albums he has worked on, maybe a link to some songs or music reel to get a feel for his style.

 - I am  a local singer looking to record my first EP, and I would like to find out how the process works with Chris. As it is the first time I will be doing this, I am looking for basic information on what Chris can offer and the studio he works from.  I would like to know what gear the studio has and anything else I might need.

 - I am a musician and would like to book Chris to record our next album. My band has worked with him in the past, and would like to be able to see his availability easily.  It is hard to get the whole band agreed on dates with all our busy lives, and there can be a lot of back and forth just finding initial dates!

 -  I am in a one man Black Metal band from the forests of Norway, and I have self-recorded my first album. I have heard that Chris offers remote mixing which I am very interested in as I would like a better sound. I can’t find any info about this on his social media pages and I would like some confirmation on the process before I send him an email.

 -  I have a podcast featuring producers, and we would like to do a feature on Chris. I would like to be able to find a little out about his work history before we have our interview.

 ## Design

### Colour Scheme

The main colours used in this will be warm monotone colours;
a warm off white, mid grey and dark grey:
#F1F0E9
#888786
#2E2FE2

For contrast, highlight colours will be used:

![Colours](/docs/colours.png)

These colours have been chosen to symbolise professionalism, while the orange and deep red hark to vintage recording equipment. They are a visual representation of a cosy and inviting space in which clients can relax and give their best performance. They are also representative of the Studio space Chris uses to record and mix. 


### Typography

### Imagery

A hero image will be used on the home page which which will  draw the user’s attention and give a strong visual representation of the site's purpose. The image will be of Chris' mixing desk and other periphary equipment. The image will be in black and white.
