- When testing on different browsers, the portfolio page grid looked streched on Safari and some iPhones. Searching google, I found that this is a common problem with how the browser reads heights in the Grid. The solution was found [here](https://newbedev.com/why-is-css-grid-row-height-different-in-safari) which fixed the issue.
